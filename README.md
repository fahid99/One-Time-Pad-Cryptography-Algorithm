# One-Time-Pad-Cryptography-Algorithm
My implementation of the one time pad cipher in Python

There are two functions within this code: encrypt() and decrypt()
  - encrypt() has two parameters: cleartext and key (of string type). You use the key to encrypt the cleartext. You return the ciphertext.
  - decrypt() has two parameters: ciphertext and key. You use the same key used to encrypt the cleartext to decripyt the ciphertext. You return the cleartext.

This algorithm was created as a way to express my own idea of how to implement the one time pad cipher. Per basic cryptographic safety standards, don't use this to actually encrypt meaningful data... unless you really want to.
